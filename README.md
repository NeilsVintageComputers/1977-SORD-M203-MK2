Documentation on my Sord M203 MKII computer is a work in progress, there is not much information available on the internet.

I have repaired the floppy controller (a very lossy Tantalum capacitor) and the main board (dirty 4-way dipswitch block) and got it booting on a original 100tpi drive and a disk supplied by Franck. 

The drives (and disks)  it came with when I obtained it were 96TPI 80Track drives, 
I now have these working and discovered quite a lot of games and other programs on the disks, but a lot of them appear too large to fit in the available memory once Basic takes up most of it.

Currently I am trying to get a original 100TPI drive to coexist on the same cable with a 96TPI drive so as to convert the disks to the original Sord format.
No success yet, the 96TPI drives have pins 34 and 6 swapped so the function of each pin is the same as the 100tpi drives. 
I think the problem could be the terminator on the 100TPI drive biases the lines via 330/220R resistor divider where the 96TPI drives pulls them up to 5V via 150R resistors. I have tried all combinations of terminators with no success.

To be continued......
